  <Param isxmlparam="0" value="1" name="BoundaryWeight" type="RichFloat" description="Boundary Preserving Weight" tooltip="The importance of the boundary during simplification. Default (1.0) means that the boundary has the same importance of the rest. Values greater than 1.0 raise boundary importance and has the effect of removing less vertices on the border. Admitted range of values (0,+inf). "/>

  <Param isxmlparam="0" value="false" name="QualityWeight" type="RichBool" description="Weighted Simplification" tooltip="Use the Per-Vertex quality as a weighting factor for the simplification. The weight is used as a error amplification value, so a vertex with a high quality value will not be simplified and a portion of the mesh with low quality values will be aggressively simplified."/>
